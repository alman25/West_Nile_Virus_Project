#West-Nile-Virus-Project

This a project about the West Nile Virus I completed using python in Jupyter notebook. 

The West Nile Virus (WNV) is a viral illness largely spread by mosquitoes. The disease is transmitted to a person when an infected mosquito bites them.

The city of Chicago, Illinois has been keeping track of mosquito populations and WNV prevalence using a series of traps that they place around the city. They are then able to study the captured specimens and monitor the state of WNV spread in the city.

I was given mosquito tracking data from 2008 to 2019.

In part 1, I performed basic EDA and data wrangling to get familiar with the dataset from the city of Chicago.

In part 2, I was given a cleaned dataset which differs from part 1 to find the relationship between the different variables and mosquito numbers, as well as the probability of finding West Nile Virus (WNV) at any particular time and location.
